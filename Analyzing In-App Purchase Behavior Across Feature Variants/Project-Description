Project Overview:
This project simulates an A/B testing scenario for a digital product feature that allows users to purchase virtual currency within a live video or streaming environment.
The feature is presented in three different variants, each designed to influence user purchase behavior and retention rates.

The analysis focuses on:
Measuring the daily revenue impact of each variant
Evaluating user behavior differences (e.g., number of purchases, purchase value)
Understanding user retention trends across variants

Key Tasks:
Defined and tested hypotheses using appropriate statistical methods
Performed data validation and exploratory analysis
Created custom retention metrics and plotted user trends over time
Recommended the optimal variant for rollout based on statistical significance and business impact

Note: 
This project is a generalized version of a technical assessment I completed as part of a job interview.
The structure, logic, and methods used here reflect my analytical approach, but the content has been adapted to preserve confidentiality.
